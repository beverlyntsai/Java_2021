 * The program generates random numbers in a specified range and prompts the user to enter the product of those numbers. 
 * Modify the program so that it also performs the following:
 * It should prompt the user to enter how many multiplication problems to generate
 * If the user enters a wrong answer, the program shall display what the correct answer is
 * It should display the userâ€™s score as a percentage of problems the user answered correctly
 * It should display the total amount of time, in seconds, that the user took to complete the quiz.
 * @see java.lang.Object
